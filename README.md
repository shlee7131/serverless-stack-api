# Serverless Stack Demo API

[Serverless Stack](http://serverless-stack.com) is a free comprehensive guide to creating full-stack serverless applications. We create a [note taking app](http://demo2.serverless-stack.com) from scratch.

This repo is for the serverless backend API that we build over the course of the tutorial. You can find the repo for the frontend React app [here](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-demo-client). And the repo for the tutorial [here](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-com).

#### Steps

This branch in the repo is related to one of the steps in the guide. Here is an index of the various steps in order.
